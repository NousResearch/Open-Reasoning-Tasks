# Describing Spatial Relationships

## Description:
This task involves accurately describing the relative positions and orientations of objects in space. It evaluates the model's ability to understand and communicate spatial concepts clearly.

## Modality:
Text only

## Examples:

### Example 1:

Input:

```
Describe the spatial relationship between the Sun, Earth, and Moon.
```

Output:

```
The Earth orbits around the Sun in an elliptical path. The Moon, in turn, orbits around the Earth. From the perspective of an observer on Earth, the Sun appears much larger than the Moon, despite the Moon being much closer to Earth. The Moon's orbit around Earth causes it to go through phases as its position relative to the Sun and Earth changes.
```

### Example 2:

Input:

```
Describe the spatial arrangement of keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard.
```

Output:

```
On a standard QWERTY keyboard, the keys are arranged in staggered horizontal rows. The top row contains number keys, with letter keys occupying the next three rows. The letter keys are not in alphabetical order; instead, they follow the QWERTY layout (named after the first six letters in the top letter row). The space bar, typically the largest key, is centered at the bottom. Special character keys are often located on the right side and top row.
