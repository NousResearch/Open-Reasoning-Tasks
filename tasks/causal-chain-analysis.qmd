# Causal Chain Analysis

## Description:
This task involves identifying and analyzing a sequence of events or factors that lead to a specific outcome. It evaluates the model's ability to understand cause-and-effect relationships, recognize direct and indirect causes, and trace the progression of events in complex scenarios.

## Modality:
Text only

## Examples:

### Example 1:

Input:

```
Analyze the causal chain that led to the 2008 financial crisis, starting with the increase in subprime mortgage lending.
```

Output:

```
Causal chain analysis of the 2008 financial crisis:

1. Increase in subprime mortgage lending
2. Creation of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) from these loans
3. High demand for MBS due to their perceived low risk and high returns
4. Further increase in subprime lending to meet MBS demand
5. Housing prices inflated due to increased demand
6. Interest rates rose, making mortgage payments unaffordable for many subprime borrowers
7. Increased defaults on subprime mortgages
8. Value of MBS plummeted
9. Banks and financial institutions holding MBS faced significant losses
10. Credit markets froze as banks became unwilling to lend
11. Economic slowdown and job losses
12. Further defaults on mortgages and other loans
13. Global financial crisis

This chain demonstrates how initial decisions in lending practices led to a complex series of events that ultimately resulted in a global economic crisis.

### Example 2:

Input:

```
Describe the causal chain that leads from deforestation to increased global warming.
```

Output:

```
Causal chain from deforestation to increased global warming:

1. Deforestation occurs (trees are cut down or burned)
2. Reduction in the number of trees available to absorb CO2
3. Immediate release of stored carbon from trees into the atmosphere
4. Soil disturbance releases additional stored carbon
5. Reduced evapotranspiration from fewer trees
6. Less cloud formation and rainfall in the area
7. Potential desertification of the deforested area
8. Increased albedo (reflectivity) of the Earth's surface
9. Changes in local and regional climate patterns
10. Disruption of carbon sink capacity of the forest ecosystem
11. Higher levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
12. Enhanced greenhouse effect
13. Increased global temperatures
14. Potential feedback loops (e.g., melting permafrost releasing more greenhouse gases)

This chain illustrates how the act of deforestation sets off a complex series of environmental changes that ultimately contribute to global warming.
