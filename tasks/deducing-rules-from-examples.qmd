# Deducing Rules from Examples

## Description:
This task involves analyzing a set of examples to infer the underlying rule or pattern that governs them. It evaluates the model's ability to recognize patterns, generalize from specific instances, and formulate abstract rules.

## Modality:
Text only

## Examples:

### Example 1:

Input:

```
Consider the following number sequence:
2, 6, 18, 54, 162, ...

What is the rule governing this sequence, and what would be the next number?
```

Output:

```
Rule: Each number in the sequence is multiplied by 3 to get the next number.

Explanation:
2 x 3 = 6
6 x 3 = 18
18 x 3 = 54
54 x 3 = 162

The next number in the sequence would be: 162 x 3 = 486

This rule can be expressed mathematically as: a(n+1) = 3 * a(n), where a(n) is the nth term in the sequence.

### Example 2:

Input:

```
In a fictional alien language, consider these translations:

"zop bik" means "blue sky"
"bik mur" means "clear sky"
"zop taf" means "blue water"

What do the individual words likely mean?
```

Output:

```
Based on these examples, we can deduce the following:

1. "zop" means "blue"
   Reasoning: It appears in both "blue sky" and "blue water"

2. "bik" means "sky"
   Reasoning: It appears in both "blue sky" and "clear sky"

3. "mur" means "clear"
   Reasoning: It's used with "sky" but not with "blue", so it must mean "clear"

4. "taf" means "water"
   Reasoning: It's used with "blue" in a phrase that doesn't mean "sky"

Rule: In this alien language, adjectives come before nouns, similar to English.

This deduction allows us to understand the meaning of each word and the basic structure of the language from just a few examples.
