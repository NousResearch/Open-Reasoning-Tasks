# Equation Derivation

## Description:
This task involves deriving mathematical equations from given information or scenarios to evaluate the model's ability to translate word problems into mathematical expressions and manipulate them to reach a solution.

## Modality:
Text only

## Examples:

### Example 1:

Input:

```
Derive an equation for the area of a circle given that the area is proportional to the square of its radius.
```

Output:

```
A = πr²
Explanation: We know the area (A) is proportional to the square of the radius (r²). The constant of proportionality is π (pi). Therefore, the equation is A = πr².

### Example 2:

Input:

```
A rectangular pool is being filled with water at a constant rate. The length of the pool is twice its width. Derive an equation for the volume of water in the pool after t minutes, given that the height of the water increases by 0.5 cm per minute.
```

Output:

```
V = t * w * 2w * 0.5
Explanation: 
- Volume = length * width * height
- Length = 2 * width
- Height after t minutes = 0.5t cm
- Substituting: V = (2w) * w * (0.5t/100) = tw²/100
- Final equation: V = 0.01tw², where V is in cubic meters, t in minutes, and w in meters.
