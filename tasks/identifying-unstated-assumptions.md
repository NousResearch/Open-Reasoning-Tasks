## Examples:

### Example 1:

Input:

```
A politician argues, "We need to increase funding for public schools to improve student performance." What unstated assumption does this argument rely on?
```

Output:

```
This argument relies on the unstated assumption that increased funding will lead to improved student performance. It assumes a direct causal relationship between money spent on education and educational outcomes, without considering other factors that might influence student performance such as teaching quality, curriculum design, or socioeconomic factors affecting students outside of school.

### Example 2:

Input:

```
A company decides to launch a new product line of luxury smartphones, stating, "This will significantly boost our profits." What unstated assumption is this decision based on?
```

Output:

```
This decision is based on several unstated assumptions:
1. There is sufficient demand for luxury smartphones in the market.
2. The company has the capability to produce high-quality luxury devices that can compete with existing offerings.
3. The profit margins on luxury smartphones will be higher than their current product lines.
4. The company's brand is strong enough to support a luxury product line.
5. The increased profits from the luxury line will outweigh the costs of development, production, and marketing.

The primary unstated assumption is that there is a viable and profitable market for their luxury smartphones, without explicitly stating market research or competitive analysis to support this belief.
