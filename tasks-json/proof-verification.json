Squaring both sides: 2 = a²/b²\r\n4. Multiply both sides by b²: 2b² = a²\r\n5. Therefore, a² is even, so a must be even.\r\n6. Let a = 2k for some integer k.\r\n7. Substituting: 2b² = (2k)² = 4k²\r\n8. Simplifying: b² = 2k²\r\n9. Therefore, b² is even, so b must be even.\r\n10. But this contradicts that a and b have no common factors.\r\n11. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, and √2 is irrational.",
        "output": "The proof is correct. It uses the method of contradiction and follows logical steps to show that assuming √2 is rational leads to a contradiction, thereby proving that √2 must be irrational."
