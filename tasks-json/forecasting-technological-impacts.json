        "input": "Forecast the potential impacts of widespread adoption of self-driving cars on urban planning and infrastructure.",
        "output": "1. Parking redesign: Less need for parking in city centers as cars can drop off passengers and park elsewhere or continue operating.\n\n2. Road infrastructure: Potential for narrower lanes and more efficient traffic flow, possibly leading to repurposing of some road space for pedestrians or cyclists.\n\n3. Traffic management: Centralized systems could optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and travel times.\n\n4. Public transportation: Possible decrease in traditional public transit use, but potential for new forms of shared autonomous vehicles.\n\n5. Urban sprawl: Easier long-distance commutes might encourage living further from city centers.\n\n6. Safety improvements: Reduced need for traffic lights and signs, as vehicles communicate directly.\n\n7. Energy infrastructure: Increased demand for electric charging stations if self-driving cars are predominantly electric.\n\n8. Loading zones: More designated areas for passenger pick-up and drop-off in commercial areas.\n\n9. Accessibility: Improved mobility for elderly and disabled individuals, potentially changing how cities design for accessibility.\n\n10. Data infrastructure: Need for robust 5G or 6G networks to support vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication."

        "output": "1. Direct knowledge transfer: Possibility of uploading information directly to the brain, potentially revolutionizing traditional learning methods.\n\n2. Enhanced cognitive abilities: Augmenting memory, focus, and processing speed, leading to accelerated learning.\n\n3. Personalized learning: Precise tracking of individual brain activity could allow for highly tailored educational experiences.\n\n4. Skill acquisition: Potential for rapid skill development by interfacing with expert systems or other individuals' experiences.\n\n5. Language learning: Near-instant language acquisition could reshape global communication and cultural exchange.\n\n6. Ethical concerns: Debates over fairness, access, and the nature of human intelligence and achievement.\n\n7. Classroom dynamics: Shift from knowledge retention to creative application and problem-solving skills.\n\n8. Assessment methods: Traditional testing could become obsolete, replaced by direct cognitive evaluation.\n\n9. Special education: Potential to address learning disabilities more effectively by directly interfacing with affected brain areas.\n\n10. Lifelong learning: Easier access to new skills and knowledge could promote continuous education throughout life.\n\n11. Information overload: Need for new skills in information filtering and critical thinking to manage vast amounts of directly accessible data.\n\n12. Social implications: Potential widening of cognitive gaps between those with and without access to the technology.\n\n13. Career preparation: Shift in focus from memorization to adaptability and creative thinking in workforce preparation."
