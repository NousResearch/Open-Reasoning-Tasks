The company has the capability to produce high-quality luxury devices that can compete with existing offerings.\n3. The profit margins on luxury smartphones will be higher than their current product lines.\n4. The company's brand is strong enough to support a luxury product line.\n5. The increased profits from the luxury line will outweigh the costs of development, production, and marketing.\n\nThe primary unstated assumption is that there is a viable and profitable market for their luxury smartphones, without explicitly stating market research or competitive analysis to support this belief."
