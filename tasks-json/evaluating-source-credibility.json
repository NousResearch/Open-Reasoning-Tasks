        "input": "Evaluate the credibility of this source:\nA blog post about climate change written by a popular celebrity with no scientific background.",
        "output": "Credibility: Low\n\nReasoning:\n1. Expertise: The celebrity lacks scientific credentials or expertise in climate science, which is a complex field requiring specialized knowledge.\n2. Bias: Celebrities often have personal or commercial interests that may influence their views.\n3. Methodology: A blog post is not a peer-reviewed scientific publication and may not follow rigorous research methods.\n4. Reputation: While the celebrity may be well-known, their reputation is likely not based on scientific accuracy or climate knowledge.\n\nConclusion: For information on climate change, more credible sources would include peer-reviewed scientific journals, reports from established climate research institutions, or statements from qualified climate scientists."

        "input": "Evaluate the credibility of this source:\nA study on the effectiveness of a new drug, published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, funded by the pharmaceutical company that developed the drug.",
        "output": "Credibility: Moderate\n\nReasoning:\n1. Expertise: The study is published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, suggesting it meets certain academic standards and has been reviewed by experts in the field.\n2. Bias: The funding from the pharmaceutical company that developed the drug introduces a potential conflict of interest, which could bias the study's design or interpretation of results.\n3. Methodology: Peer-reviewed journals typically require rigorous methodology, but the exact methods would need to be examined to confirm their validity.\n4. Reputation: Medical journals generally have good reputations for scientific accuracy, but the specific journal's standing would need to be considered.\n\nConclusion: While the peer-review process lends some credibility, the potential bias from industry funding suggests caution. This study should be considered alongside other independent research on the drug's effectiveness. Disclosure of conflicts of interest and replication of results by independent researchers would increase credibility."
