Pour water from the 6-liter jug into the 10-liter jug until it's full (which takes 6 liters).\r\n3. The 6-liter jug now contains 0 liters, and the 10-liter jug contains 10 liters.\r\n4. Pour water from the 10-liter jug back into the 6-liter jug until it's full.\r\n5. The 10-liter jug now contains exactly 4 liters of water."

        "output": "To find the maximum diameter of the rug:\r\n1. Available space: \r\n   Length: 15 - (2 * 2) = 11 feet\r\n   Width: 10 - (2 * 2) = 6 feet\r\n2. The rug must fit within both dimensions, so we use the smaller dimension (6 feet).\r\n3. The maximum diameter of the rug is 6 feet.\r\n\r\nThis ensures the rug fits within the room while maintaining at least 2 feet of space from all walls."
