        "output": "The Miranda v. Arizona decision established the requirement for law enforcement to inform suspects of their rights before custodial interrogation. This precedent affects current law enforcement practices in several ways:\n\n1. Miranda Warnings: Police must inform suspects of their rights, including:\n   - The right to remain silent\n   - That anything they say can be used against them in court\n   - The right to an attorney\n   - If they can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed for them\n\n2. Custodial Interrogations: These rights apply when a person is in custody and being interrogated, not just during formal arrests.\n\n3. Admissibility of Statements: If Miranda warnings are not given, statements made by the suspect during interrogation may be inadmissible in court.\n\n4. Waiver of Rights: Suspects can waive their Miranda rights, but it must be done knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.\n\n5. Exceptions: There are some exceptions, such as public safety situations where immediate questioning may be necessary.\n\n6. Training: Law enforcement agencies must train officers on proper Miranda procedures to ensure compliance.\n\n7. Ongoing Legal Interpretations: Courts continue to refine the application of Miranda rights in various situations.\n\nThis precedent significantly impacts how police conduct interrogations and how courts evaluate the admissibility of confessions or statements made by suspects."
