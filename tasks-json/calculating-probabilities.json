Probability of drawing second ace, given first was an ace: 3/51\r\n3. Probability of both events occurring: (1/13) * (3/51) = 3/663 = 1/221\r\n4. 1/221 â‰ˆ 0.0045 or 0.45%"

P(Vanilla) = 50/100 = 0.5\r\n4. P(Both) = 30/100 = 0.3\r\n5. P(Chocolate or Vanilla) = 0.6 + 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.8\r\n6. 0.8 = 80%"
