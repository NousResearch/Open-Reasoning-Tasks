        "output": "Rule: Each number in the sequence is multiplied by 3 to get the next number.\n\nExplanation:\n2 x 3 = 6\n6 x 3 = 18\n18 x 3 = 54\n54 x 3 = 162\n\nThe next number in the sequence would be: 162 x 3 = 486\n\nThis rule can be expressed mathematically as: a(n+1) = 3 * a(n), where a(n) is the nth term in the sequence."

        "output": "Based on these examples, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. \"zop\" means \"blue\"\n   Reasoning: It appears in both \"blue sky\" and \"blue water\"\n\n2. \"bik\" means \"sky\"\n   Reasoning: It appears in both \"blue sky\" and \"clear sky\"\n\n3. \"mur\" means \"clear\"\n   Reasoning: It's used with \"sky\" but not with \"blue\", so it must mean \"clear\"\n\n4. \"taf\" means \"water\"\n   Reasoning: It's used with \"blue\" in a phrase that doesn't mean \"sky\"\n\nRule: In this alien language, adjectives come before nouns, similar to English.\n\nThis deduction allows us to understand the meaning of each word and the basic structure of the language from just a few examples."
