        "output": "The flight arrives in Sydney at 5:00 PM on Wednesday. Here's the calculation:\r\n1. Los Angeles to Sydney is approximately a 19-hour time difference (Sydney is ahead).\r\n2. 15 hours of flight time + 19 hours of time zone difference = 34 hours.\r\n3. 34 hours from Monday 11:00 PM brings us to Wednesday 5:00 PM.\r\nNote: This calculation doesn't account for potential seasonal time changes or the exact flight path."
