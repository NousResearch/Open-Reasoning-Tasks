        "output": "1. United States:\n   - Larger personal space bubble, typically arm's length or more\n   - Direct eye contact is common and expected\n   - Handshakes are a standard greeting\n\n2. Japan:\n   - Smaller personal space, closer physical proximity is common\n   - Less direct eye contact, often seen as respectful\n   - Bowing is the traditional greeting\n\n3. Reasons for differences:\n   - Population density: Japan's higher population density may contribute to comfort with less personal space\n   - Cultural values: US emphasizes individualism, while Japan focuses more on group harmony\n   - Historical influences: Different social norms developed over time in each culture\n\n4. Similarities:\n   - Both cultures have unspoken rules about personal space\n   - In both, personal space expectations may vary in different contexts (e.g., public transport vs. social gatherings)\n\n5. Implications:\n   - These differences can lead to misunderstandings in cross-cultural interactions\n   - Awareness of these differences is important for effective communication and respect in international settings"
