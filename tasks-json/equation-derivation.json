        "output": "A = πr²\r\nExplanation: We know the area (A) is proportional to the square of the radius (r²). The constant of proportionality is π (pi). Therefore, the equation is A = πr²."

        "output": "V = t * w * 2w * 0.5\r\nExplanation: \r\n- Volume = length * width * height\r\n- Length = 2 * width\r\n- Height after t minutes = 0.5t cm\r\n- Substituting: V = (2w) * w * (0.5t/100) = tw²/100\r\n- Final equation: V = 0.01tw², where V is in cubic meters, t in minutes, and w in meters."
