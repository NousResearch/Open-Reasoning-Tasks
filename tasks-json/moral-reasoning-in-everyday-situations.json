        "input": "You find a wallet on the street containing $500 and the owner's ID. What would be the most ethical course of action, and why?",
        "output": "The most ethical course of action would be to return the wallet with all its contents intact to the owner or to the local authorities.\n\nReasoning:\n1. Respect for property: The money and wallet belong to someone else, and taking them would be theft.\n2. Golden Rule: Consider how you would want others to act if they found your wallet.\n3. Integrity: Returning the wallet demonstrates personal honesty and contributes to a trustworthy society.\n4. Potential need: The owner might desperately need the money or other items in the wallet.\n5. Legal obligation: In many jurisdictions, keeping found property is illegal.\n\nWhile one might argue that keeping the money could benefit you or that the owner was careless, these arguments don't outweigh the ethical imperative to return others' property. The momentary gain doesn't justify the breach of ethics and potential legal consequences."

        "input": "Your close friend confides in you that they're cheating on their partner. The partner is also your friend. What's the most ethical way to handle this situation?",
        "output": "This situation presents a complex ethical dilemma with no clear-cut \"right\" answer. Here's a reasoned approach:\n\n1. Encourage honesty: The most ethical first step would be to strongly encourage your friend who is cheating to come clean to their partner. Explain the importance of honesty in relationships and the potential consequences of their actions.\n\n2. Set boundaries: Make it clear to your cheating friend that you're uncomfortable keeping this secret and that you won't lie if directly asked by their partner.\n\n3. Consider the consequences: Weigh the potential outcomes of telling vs. not telling. Will revealing the information cause more harm than good? Or will keeping the secret potentially lead to more hurt in the long run?\n\n4. Respect confidentiality: Generally, information shared in confidence should be kept private. However, this isn't an absolute rule, especially when serious harm could result from silence.\n\n5. Seek advice: If possible, consult a trusted third party (like a counselor) for advice without revealing identities.\n\n6. Time-limited ultimatum: If your friend refuses to come clean, you might give them a deadline, after which you'll feel ethically obligated to tell their partner.\n\nThe most ethical course of action would likely be to strongly encourage your friend to tell their partner, while making it clear that you won't actively lie to cover for them. This balances loyalty to your friend, the partner's right to know, and your own ethical integrity.\n\nRemember, there's no perfect solution here, and any action will have complex consequences. The goal is to act in a way that aligns with your core ethical principles while minimizing harm to all involved."
