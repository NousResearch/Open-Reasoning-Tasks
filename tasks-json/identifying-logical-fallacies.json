        "input": "\"All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore, penguins can fly.\" What logical fallacy is present in this argument?",
        "output": "This argument contains the fallacy of Hasty Generalization.\r\nExplanation: The premise \"All birds can fly\" is an overgeneralization. While many birds can fly, there are exceptions like penguins, ostriches, and emus. This fallacy occurs when a general conclusion is drawn from a small or unrepresentative sample."

        "input": "\"If we allow same-sex marriage, next people will want to marry their pets!\" What logical fallacy is present in this statement?",
        "output": "This statement contains the Slippery Slope fallacy.\r\nExplanation: The Slippery Slope fallacy assumes that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events resulting in a significant and often undesirable effect. It exaggerates the consequences of a proposed action without providing evidence for the alleged chain reaction."
