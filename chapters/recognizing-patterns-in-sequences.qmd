# Recognizing Patterns in Sequences

## Description:
This task involves identifying and extending patterns in numerical, alphabetical, or symbolic sequences. It evaluates the model's ability to recognize underlying rules and apply them to predict subsequent elements in a sequence.

## Modality:
Text only

## Examples:

### Example 1:

Input:

```
Identify the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ?
```

Output:

```
The next number in the sequence is 64.
Explanation: Each number in the sequence is doubling (multiplied by 2) from the previous number. The pattern is:
2 * 2 = 4
4 * 2 = 8
8 * 2 = 16
16 * 2 = 32
32 * 2 = 64
```

### Example 2:

Input:

```
What comes next in this sequence? A, C, F, J, O, ?
```

Output:

```
The next letter in the sequence is U.
Explanation: The pattern is based on the alphabetical position of each letter, with the difference between positions increasing by 1 each time:
A to C: 2 positions
C to F: 3 positions
F to J: 4 positions
J to O: 5 positions
O to U: 6 positions
```

### Example 3:

Input:

```
Continue this pattern: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ?
```

Output:

```
The next number in the sequence is 21.
Explanation: This is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 5 = 8
5 + 8 = 13
8 + 13 = 21
```
