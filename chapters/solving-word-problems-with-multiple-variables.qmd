# Solving Word Problems with Multiple Variables

## Description:
This task involves interpreting word problems, identifying relevant variables, and constructing equations to solve complex scenarios. It evaluates the model's ability to translate real-world situations into mathematical expressions and solve systems of equations.

## Modality:
Text only

## Examples:

### Example 1:

Input:

```
A farm has chickens and cows. If there are 50 heads and 140 legs in total, how many chickens and cows are there?
```

Output:

```
Let's solve this step by step:

1. Define variables:
   x = number of chickens
   y = number of cows

2. Set up equations:
   Equation 1 (heads): x + y = 50
   Equation 2 (legs): 2x + 4y = 140

3. Solve the system of equations:
   From Equation 1: y = 50 - x
   Substitute into Equation 2: 2x + 4(50 - x) = 140
   Simplify: 2x + 200 - 4x = 140
   -2x = -60
   x = 30

4. Find y:
   y = 50 - 30 = 20

Therefore, there are 30 chickens and 20 cows.

### Example 2:

Input:

```
A rectangle's length is 5 cm more than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 70 cm, what are its dimensions?
```

Output:

```
Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Define variables:
   w = width of the rectangle
   l = length of the rectangle

2. Express length in terms of width:
   l = 2w + 5

3. Set up equation using perimeter formula:
   2l + 2w = 70
   2(2w + 5) + 2w = 70

4. Solve for w:
   4w + 10 + 2w = 70
   6w = 60
   w = 10 cm

5. Calculate length:
   l = 2(10) + 5 = 25 cm

Therefore, the rectangle's dimensions are 10 cm wide and 25 cm long.
