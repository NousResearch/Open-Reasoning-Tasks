# Mental Rotation Tasks

## Description:
This task involves mentally rotating objects or shapes and predicting their appearance from different angles. It evaluates the model's ability to manipulate spatial information mentally.

## Modality:
Text only

## Examples:

### Example 1:

Input:

```
Imagine a cube with different symbols on each face: a star, a circle, a triangle, a square, a heart, and a diamond. If the star is on top and the circle is facing you, what symbol would be on the bottom face?
```

Output:

```
The diamond would be on the bottom face. In a cube, opposite faces are always 180 degrees apart. Since the star is on top, its opposite face (the bottom) would have the diamond.
```

### Example 2:

Input:

```
Picture the letter 'F' in your mind. If you rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, then flip it horizontally, what would it look like?
```

Output:

```
After rotating 'F' 90 degrees clockwise, it would look like '⊥'. After flipping it horizontally, it would appear as '⊢'. The vertical line would be on the left, with the two horizontal lines extending to the right, the longer one at the top and the shorter one in the middle.
```
