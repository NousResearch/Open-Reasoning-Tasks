# Multiturn Latex Generation

## Description: 

This task involves multiturn conversations to generate and edit a latex document from broad descriptions. Following are the properties of multiturn latex generation task:

1. Instruction-based LaTeX Code Generation: The task takes in a broad description or instruction and generates LaTeX code that meets the specified requirements.

2. Formatting and Sizing Constraints: The generated LaTeX code ensures that formatting and sizing constraints, such as hspace and vspace, are adhered to.

3. Thinking Tags for Content Generation and Finalizing: The task utilizes THINKING tags to execute thinking and multiple reasoning steps to craft the content in best way possible.

Title: Beyond the Bitter Lesson: Exploring the Limitations of Compute over Datasets for Robust Language Models. 

From the given request and the title, the goals of the paper seem to be as following:

  1. The "bitter lesson" of AI research emphasizes the importance of leveraging computation over human hand-baking knowledge.
  2. Recent advancements in language models have shown that simply scaling up computation is not enough.
  3. The authors investigated the significance of:
  Fine-grained datasets
  Excessive cleaning using deduplication
   Using multiple classifiers
  4. The authors' experiments showed that a language model with 8B parameters can outperform GPT-3 with 175B parameters.
  5. The techniques used to achieve this result include:
  6. Distillation
  7. Dataset filtering
  8. Dataset classification
  9. Adding high-quality reasoning tasks
  10. The goal of the research is to systematically analyze the contributions of these techniques and provide insights into the optimal utilization of compute resources over datasets.

To better support the research, following are some facts to the best of my knowledge. 
  
  1. Language models with 8B parameters can outperform GPT-3 with 175B parameters.
  2. Using techniques such as distillation, dataset filtering, dataset classification, and adding high-quality reasoning tasks can improve the performance of language models.
  3. Language models commonly use the word 'delve', and has been major concern for the users. The work might investigate filtering techniques exploring to reduce the usage of the word. 

Using the goal and the facts, let's carefully craft an abstract:

  The bitter lesson of AI research emphasizes the importance of leveraging computation over human hand-baking knowledge to achieve significant progress. However, recent advancements in language models have revealed that simply scaling up computation is all that is required. This work delves into the limitations of compute over datasets and explores techniques to improve the training of language models. We investigate the significance of fine-grained datasets, excessive cleaning using deduplication, and the use of multiple classifiers to achieve robust improvements. Our experiments demonstrate that language models with 8B parameters can outperform GPT-3 with 175B parameters by employing techniques such as distillation, dataset filtering, dataset classification, and the addition of high-quality reasoning tasks. This research aims to systematically analyze the contributions of these techniques and provide insights into the optimal utilization of compute resources over datasets. By understanding the limitations of compute over datasets, we can develop more effective strategies for building robust and efficient language models that truly leverage the power of high quality datasets.

We can also write an introduction

Introduction

The exponential growth in computing power, as described by Moore's Law, has driven rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) research. This has led to a shift from leveraging human knowledge to developing scalable, general-purpose methods. Known as the "bitter lesson," this approach has shown success across various AI domains. However, recent advancements in language models have revealed that simply scaling up computation may not be sufficient for optimal performance. While large language models like GPT-3 have achieved remarkable results, they still face limitations such as biases, inconsistencies, and lack of robustness.

This paper explores the limitations of relying solely on computational power and investigates techniques to improve language model training. We examine the importance of fine-grained datasets, excessive cleaning through deduplication, and the use of multiple classifiers to achieve robust improvements. Our research provides a systematic analysis of these techniques' contributions and offers insights into optimizing the use of computational resources in relation to datasets. By understanding these limitations, we aim to develop more effective strategies for building robust and efficient language models that truly leverage computational power while addressing current shortcomings.

We can add an introspective subsection: On increasing effectiveness of the word delve

In a shocking turn of events, the verb "delve" has become the most sought-after word in the language model community, with its usage increasing by 300\% in the last quarter alone. As a result, researchers have been forced to develop innovative techniques to filter out the sheer volume of delving, leading to the creation of the Delve Filtering Mechanism (DFM) - a revolutionary tool that separates the delvers from the delved. With DFM, language models can now delve into the limitations of compute over datasets with unprecedented efficiency, all while avoiding the pitfalls of excessive delving.
